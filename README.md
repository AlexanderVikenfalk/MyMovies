2.  Go to the diretory of the app and type in "npm install" via a task runner (node must be installed).
3.  Type "npm start" 
4.  Open your web browser and navigate to localhost:3000

#### Other remarks ####
As usual there are a lot of things I would like to improve and work on but at least I got to try my hand at using React which was the puprose of the excersise.
