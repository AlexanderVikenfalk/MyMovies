#### About this project: 
This first react project is a small web app that fetches an array of movies from an API a returns a list that's controlled by the user via real time filtering

#### Technologies used: 
* **CSS 3** for design.
* **JSX (ES6)/ React** for effects and functionality.

#### How to use this service ####
1.  Download/ clone the repository
2.  Go to the diretory of the app and type in "npm install" via a task runner (node must be installed).
3.  Type "npm start" 
4.  Open your web browser and navigate to localhost:3000
5.  Type something in the searchbox to filter the list of movies (search-function is case sensetive and the movies have their titles in Swedish). OR try filtering the list after genres via the dropdown to the right.

#### Other remarks ####
As usual there are a lot of things I would like to improve and work on but at least I got to try my hand at using React which was the puprose of the excersise.
